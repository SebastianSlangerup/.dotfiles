# My .dotfiles

This is going to be used as a personal storage of all my configuration files.
I plan to set it up so that I can restore all of my configurations at the push of a button, whenever I decide to get a new computer or re-install my operating system.

Everything is still very much *work in progress*, as I have very little experience with dotfiles in general.
